A python replacement for logrotate

## Installation
#### with pip
	pip install dreidel
#### or checkout the github-branch
	git clone git://github.com/bmaeser/dreidel.git

## Usage
By default dreidel expects a configfile at /etc/dreidel/dreidel.conf, but you can specify a custom location with the -f (--file) option.
#### Full list of command line-options:
	Usage: dreidel.py [options]

	Options:
	    --version             show program's version number and exit
		-h, --help            show this help message and exit
		-f CONFIGFILE, --file=CONFIGFILE
                        	  read configuration from CONFIGFILE.defaults to
                        /etc/dreidel.conf
 		-l LOGFILE, --logfile=LOGFILE
                        logfile location. defaults to /var/log/dreidel.log
 		-v, --verbose         make a lot of noise at the logfile


#### Configfile-format
A full example:

    [/path/to/file]
    compress=true #default to true
    olddir=/path/to/olddir #uncomment if you don't want to move files
    rotate=3 #nr of old versions to keep, 0=no rotation / nothing gets deleted
    date=yesterday #take the day before today # defaults to today
    prerotate=#command to be executed before the moment
    postrotate=#command to be executed after the moment


## Usage scenarios
Create 2 configfiles:
    touch /etc/dreidel/daily.conf
    touch /etc/dreidel/weekly.con
Let cron execute daily.conf every day at 00:00, and weekly.conf every sunday at 00:00.

### Scenario 1: nginx-logfile-rotation (daily)
todo
### Scenario 2: backup of /etc/ (weekly)
todo
